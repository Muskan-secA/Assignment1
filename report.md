# Photography hobby website

## Design methods
- **Typography and Colors**: I would go for a highly cleaned-up basic font like Arial and a consistent color scheme of black, white, green for better readability and aesthetic purposes.
- **Layout**: Flexbox will help me in keeping this navigation responsive and Grid for this gallery, so that's interesting.
**multimedijs**: Adding images and video makes the content interesting, and through view, it represents the theme of the image.

## Resource management
Introduced basic HTML-structure, made sure of translation markup;
Added content sections which relate to photography and included in the content of an unstructured list of following benefits;
Styling of the website with external CSS-file, consistently separating the content from design;
An email form that enables the user to provide feedback;
Addition of multimedia information to make it more interactive for the end-user.
Flexbox and Grid design methods to make the website responsive and feel better.
